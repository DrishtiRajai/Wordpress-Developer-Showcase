Hi, I'm Drishti — a WordPress developer with multiple internships and standalone projects under my belt.

While I’ve recently started being active on GitHub, I’ve been working with WordPress for over 6 years through:

- 🧩 Custom theme development
- 🔌 Plugin building
- 🎯 Freelance and internship work (remote + collaborative)

This repository acts as a summary of my WordPress journey.

## 🎯 Why I’m on GitHub Now

Although I’ve used Git + GitHub in internships and teams, I focused more on delivery than maintaining public repos.  
I’m now actively bringing and organizing my work on GitHub and learning in public.
